Make a Difference for Students with Dyslexia in Just 30 Minutes a Day

Dear %%first_name%%,

Students who struggle to read in the early grades—including those with dyslexia—need efficient, research-based intervention to ensure success throughout their academic journey. You can make a significant impact on all students with the updated Voyager Passport® for K–5 students. It is the reading intervention packed with essentials you need to teach reading.

According to the International Dyslexia Association, the most effective solutions are those that follow a Structured Literacy  approach.

Based on decades of research, updated Voyager Passport aligns to IDA’s Structured Literacy approach for student success in reading. Its corrective feedback and more time on task to master critical reading skills helps students with dyslexia make positive strides toward a lifetime of literacy.
